<pre>
dp_traceProc procedure command
</pre>
Sets up a procedure trace on procedure and returns a trace id  to
identify  the  new procedure trace.  Procedure may be an abbrevation.
In any furthur evaluation of Tcl code,  right  before  any
procedure whose name starts with the string procedure is evaluated,
command is evaluated with the arguments of the trace id,  the
level  of  nesting, and the command line that was to be evaluated
before the procedure trace interrupted.
<P>
Example usage:
<pre>
proc PrintTrace {traceId level args} {
        set fmtstr "%[set level]s"
        puts stdout "[format $fmtstr ""] $args"
}

dp_traceProc e PrintTrace;
</pre>
From now on, all commands starting with the character "e" will be
traced.
<pre>
dp_untraceProc traceId
</pre>
Removes the procedure trace  defined  by  traceId.
