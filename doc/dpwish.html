Dpwish  is  a  simple  program  consisting  of  the  Tcl  command
language,  the  Tk toolkit, the Tcl-DP extension, and a main program
that reads commands from standard input or from a file.   It
creates  a  main window (dpwish only) and then processes Tcl commands.
If dpwish is invoked with filename equal ``-'', it  reads
Tcl  commands  interactively  from standard input.  Otherwise, it
will read commands from the specified  file.   It  will  continue
processing  commands until all windows have been deleted or until
end-of-file is reached on standard input.  If the dpwish  executable
is  named  dptcl, then the -notk flag is implied.  Finally,
dpsh is a version of dpwish that contains  only  th  Tcl  command
language,  the  Tcl-DP  extension,  and a main program that reads
commands from standard input or from a file.  If there  exists  a
file  .dpwishrc  in  the  home directory of the user, dpwish (and
dptcl) will evaluate the file as a Tcl script just before reading
the  first  command  from standard input.  The corresponding file
for dpsh is .dpshrc If the -file option is provided to  Tk,  then
dpwish  (or dptcl or dpsh) reads Tcl commands from the file named
in the -file option.  These commands will normally create an  interactive
interface consisting of one or more widgets.  When the
end of the command file  is  reached,  dpwish  will  continue  to
respond  to  X events until all windows have been deleted.  There
is no automatic evaluation of .dpwishrc in  this  case,  but  the
script file can always source it if desired.
<P>
Dpwish, dptcl, and dpsh set the  following  Tcl  variables:
<UL><LI>
<pre>
argc
</pre>
Contains  a count of the number of arg arguments (0 if none), not
including the options described above.
</LI><LI><pre>
argv
</pre>
Contains a Tcl  list
whose  elements  are the arg arguments (not including the options
described above), in order, or an empty string if  there  are  no
arg  arguments.
</LI><LI><pre>
argv0
</pre>
Contains  fileName  if it was specified. Otherwise, contains the name by
which  dpwish  was  invoked.
</LI><LI><pre>
tcl_interactive
</pre>
Contains 1 if dpwish is reading commands interactively (no -file option
was specified and  standard  input  is  a terminal-like device), 0 otherwise.
</LI></UL>

If you create a Tcl script in a file whose first line is
<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/dpwish -f
</pre>
then you can invoke the script file directly from your  shell  if
you  mark it as executable.  If you create a Tcl script in a file
whose first line is
<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/dptcl -f
</pre>
then you can invoke the script file directly from your  shell  if
you  mark  it as executable.  This form implies the -notk option.
The same technique can be used for dpsh.
<P>
The example above assume that dpwish  and  dptcl  have  been  installed
in  the default location in /usr/local/bin;  if they are
installed somewhere else then you'll have  to  modify  the  above
line to match.

When any of the programs are invoked interactively they  normally
prompt  for  each command with ``% ''.  You can change the prompt
by setting the variables tcl_prompt1 and tcl_prompt2.
If variable tcl_prompt1 exists then it must consist of a Tcl script to
output a prompt;  instead of  outputting  a  prompt  dpwish  will
evaluate  the script in tcl_prompt1.  The variable tcl_prompt2 is
used in a similar way when a newline is  typed  but  the  current
command  isn't  yet  complete;  if tcl_prompt2 isn't set then no
prompt is output for incomplete commands.
