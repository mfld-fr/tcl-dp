A procedural object is a Tcl procedure that represents an object.
The  utility  commands  described  in  this man page allow one to
easily implement procedural objects using Tcl scripting only.
<P>
A procedural object is usually implemented in C  (e.g.,  as  a  C
struct)  for  speed but has a Tcl access interface.  For example,
Tk implements its widget classes in C but provides Tcl interfaces
to  access  those widgets.  Tk uses a procedure to represent each
widget instance.
<P>
The first argument of one of these procedural objects is a method
selector.   In other words, if object is the name of a procedural
object:
<pre>
object method ?args ...?
</pre>
If you use the utility procedures described in this man  page  to
implement  a procedural object, that object will have a class and
may have slots.  The class of the object determines what  methods
the  object  will respond to.  No class inheritance is supported.
dp_objectCreateProc class object
<P>
This command creates a new Tcl procedure to represent a  new  object.
The new procedure will have the name object and have the
given class.
<pre>
dp_objectExists object
</pre>
This command returns 1 if a procedural object named object exists
in the interpreter and returns 0 otherwise.
<pre>
dp_objectFree object
</pre>
This command frees up the resources associated with  the  object,
which  should  have been created with dp_objectCreateProc.  After
using dp_objectFree on an object, no more references to that  object
or its slots should be made.
<pre>
dp_objectSlots object
</pre>
This command returns a list of the slots of  the  procedural  object,
which  should  have been created with dp_objectCreateProc.
<pre>
dp_objectSlot object slot
</pre>
This command returns the value of a slot of  the  procedural  object,
which  should  have been created with dp_objectCreateProc.
<pre>
dp_objectSlotSet object slot value
</pre>
This command sets the value of a slot of the object, which should
have been created with dp_objectCreateProc.  If slot is not yet a
slot of the object, this command will make slot a slot of the object.
Thus, slots  can be dynamically added to objects created
using dp_objectCreateProc.   A slot may not be an array.
<pre>
dp_objectSlotAppend object slot value
</pre>
This command uses lappend  to  append  the  given  value  to  the
current  value  of the slot of the object, which should have been
created with dp_objectCreateProc.  If slot is not yet a  slot  of
the  object,  this  command  will make slot a slot of the object.
Thus, slots can be dynamically added  to  objects  created  using
dp_objectCreateProc.
<pre>
dp_objectConfigure class object ?options?
</pre>
This command provides a Tk "configure" style of slot  access  for
the  procedural  object,  which  should  have  been created using
dp_objectCreateProc.  (See example usage  below.)   The  argument
class  should  be  the class of the object.  The optional options
argument can be used in the following three formats:
<pre>
dp_objectConfigure class object ?-slot?
dp_objectConfigure class object ?-slot val -slot val ...?
dp_objectConfigure class object
</pre>
The first format of dp_objectConfigure retrieves  the  configuration
entry for a given slot.  A configuration entry for a slot is
a triplet of the format of {-slot default value}, where -slot  is
the  slot  name  prepended  with a hyphen, default is the default
value for the slot, and value is the current value of  the  slot.
(Note that this configuration entry format for slots is different
than the configuration entry format of Tk widget options.)
<P>
The second format of dp_objectConfigure sets the  current  values
of several slots of an object.
<P>
The third format of dp_objectConfigure retrieves  the  configuration
entries of all the slots of the object.
<P>
Note that to use dp_objectConfigure, you must  prepend  a  hyphen
('-')  to  each slot name.  (e.g., "slot" becomes "-slot".)  This
was designed for pseudo-compatability with the Tk style of widget
option configuration, since widget options in Tk are all prefixed
with a '-'.  Also, any slot names, slot, should be  fully  specified
and not abbreviated.
<P>
The command dp_objectCreateProc creates a new Tcl procedure whose
name  is object to represent a new procedural object. You may invoke
various methods on the procedural object, using the  following
general form:
<pre>
object method ?arg0 arg1 ...?
</pre>
The method argument and the class of  the  object  determine  the
method invoked.  Methods for classes are specified using the following
form:
<pre>
proc class.method {self arg0 ... argN} {
   ...method body...
}
</pre>
The first argument self is required in the method  specification.
The  self  argument  is  set  to  the name of the object that the
method will get called upon.  The following is a  simple  example
of  using  the above commands to create a procedural object using
Tcl scripting only:
<pre>
# Define point creator.
#
proc makePoint {aPoint args} {
   eval dp_objectCreateProc point $aPoint;
   dp_objectSlotSet $aPoint x 0;
   dp_objectSlotSet $aPoint y 0;
   eval $aPoint configure $args
   return $aPoint;
}

# Define methods of point class.
#
proc point.configure {aPoint args} {
   eval dp_objectConfigure point $aPoint $args;
}

proc point.slot-value {aPoint slot} {
  dp_objectSlot $aPoint $slot;
}

proc point.destroy {aPoint slot} {
  dp_objectFree $aPoint $slot;
}

proc point.draw {aPoint} {
   set x [dp_objectSlot $aPoint x];
   set y [dp_objectSlot $aPoint y];
   dot $x $y;
}

# Instatiate a point and test it out.
#
makePoint p;                    # Makes the point
p configure -x 10 -y 20;        # sets the value to (10,20)
p configure -x;                 # returns {-x {} 10}
p configure;                    # returns {{-x {} 10} {-y {} 20}}
p slot-value x;                 # returns 10
p draw;                         # calls "dot 10 20"
dp_objectExists p;              # returns 1
dp_objectExists p1;             # returns 0
p destroy;                      # destroys the object
