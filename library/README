This directory contains several Tcl/Tk scripts that define
various autoloading Tcl/Tk procedures required by the Tcl-DP
package.

Distributed programming utilities:

	rpc.tcl		-- remote procedure calling utilities
	distribObj.tcl	-- distributed object utilities

Miscellaneous utilities:

	match.tcl	-- string matching utilities
	ldelete.tcl	-- list delete element
	lremovedup.tcl	-- list remove duplicates

Normally, objects (like Tk widgets) are implemented in C.  We
have provided utilities, however, to allow easy implementation of
objects using Tcl scripting only:

	oo.tcl	-- utilities for defining objects by Tcl scripting
