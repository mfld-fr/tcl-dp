<hr>
The above routines give C access to the Tcl-DP  remote  procedure
call commands (dp_RPC and dp_RDO).
<P>
If the events argument is less than 0, then no events are handled
while  waiting  for  an RPC return value on the given RPC connec-
tion.  If the events argument is not less than 0, then the events
argument  is the same type of argument as passed to Tk_DoOneEvent
and allows one to flag for the event types which will be  handled
while  waiting for an RPC return value.  This events argument, if
not less than 0, is automatically or'ed with TK_FILE_EVENTS  flag
so that file events are always handled.
<P>
If the timeout argument is zero or less than zero, timeout will
not be checked.
