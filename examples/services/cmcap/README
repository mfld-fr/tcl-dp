This README describes the purpose of the /etc/cmcap file and
gives hints on how to install it.  

Every machine running any distributed continous media software 
developed by the Plateau Continuous Media Project at Berkeley 
must have an /etc/cmcap file.  These /etc/cmcap files describe 
the continuous media capabilities of each machine and give other 
information about each machine.  Each machine will have its own 
distinct /etc/cmcap file as /etc directories are not shared between 
machines (e.g., the /etc/cmcap file for machine X will describe 
machine X only and will be different than the /etc/cmcap file for 
machine Y.)

Contents of this directory (where this README resides):

   README		- this README file
   cmcap		- template /etc/cmcap file
   cmcap.l		- man page describing /etc/cmcap file
   cmcap.tcl		- autoloading Tcl/Tk utility procedures

The file cmcap directory is a sample, template cmcap file.  Copy 
this template cmcap file to the /etc directory for each machine 
which will run any Berkeley Plateau distributed continous 
media software.

Then, in these /etc/cmcap files, edit and where necessary comment out
the lines that do not correctly describe the capabilities of each
local machine.  You will most likely need root or owner access to
write into the /etc directory.  Don't forget to make /etc/cmcap
readable to everyone.  After you are done editing the /etc/cmcap
file, change its protections so that it is not writable, for
security reasons!

The file cmcap.l in this directory is a man page for
more information about the /etc/cmcap file.

The file cmcap.tcl is an autoloading Tcl/Tk script.  You must
copy this file to the directory where the Tcl/Tk stores your
existing autoloading Tcl/Tk scripts.  Look at the value of the
TCL_LIBRARY in your environment variables or in the Tcl Makefile
for the path of this directory.  Edit the tclIndex file in that
directory to include information about the cmcap.tcl file you
just copied over or have Tcl/Tk automatically update that
tclIndex file with the "auto_mkindex" Tcl command.
