Tcl-DP 4.2 TODOs
----------------

Can only build with make or nmake.  This is because the IDEs like Eclipse
or Visual Studio add the configuration name (like Release or Debug) to the
path to libdp42.so (UNIX) or dp42.dll (Windows).  While this is proper IDE
behavior, CMakeLists.txt is not set up to handle this variation in library
path.

IPM test hangs

RPC test fails on Windows

Several UDP tests fail in Windows.

Look into removing compat/ and teki/


Pre-4.1 TODOs
-------------

Add a better security model.  It would be nice to have 3.5's ability to check
every line of an RPC as it is executed rather than a one-time check.

HP9 fails TCP buffer tests.  I don't think the system will allow a socket
    buffer < 8192 bytes.

Several UDP tests fail in Windows.

Sending a large (20k+) RPC hangs in Windows.

Better documentation of obscure feature like oo.tcl.

Abstract Teki so that both text- and GUI-installs are possible.
