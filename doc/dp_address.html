</pre>
The dp_address command provides access to an  internal  array  of
internet  address records.  These address records are appropriate
for use as arguments to the  dp_sendTo  and  receiveFrom  network
communication  commands  of Tcl-DP (Tcl Distributed Programming).
The argument option specifies the operation to be performed.  The
valid options are:
<pre><a name="Create">
dp_address create host port
</a></pre>
Creates an internal address record that represents the given host
address  and  port  internet information.  Returns an addr handle
that is appropriate for use as an argument to the  dp_sendTo  and
dp_receiveFrom  commands and as the addr argument in the commands
below.  Port can be specified by number or by service  name  (see
services(5) for more information).  If specified by service name,
it must be a UDP service.
<pre><a name="Delete">
dp_address delete addr
</a></pre>
Delete the previously created internal address  record  that  has
the given addr handle.
<pre><a name="Info">
dp_address info addr
</a></pre>
Return a list of the form {host port {names}} associated with the
given addr handle.  Host is the associated internet address, port
is the associated port number, and names is a list of  associated
hostnames.   The  primary  host name is given first.
