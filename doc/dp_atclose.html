<pre>
dp_atclose sockId option ?cmd?
</pre>
The dp_atclose command manages the dp_atclose  list,  a  list  of
callback  routines that are evaluated just before sockId is actually
closed.  This is useful for networking  applications,  where
filehandlers  associated  with  a  socket  must be deleted when a
socket is closed.  The argument option specifies the operation to
be performed on the dp_atclose list.  The valid options are:
<pre>
dp_atclose sockId list
</pre>
Returns the current dp_atclose list associated with sockId.
<pre>
dp_atclose sockId set newList
</pre>
Sets the dp_atclose list associated with sockId to newList.
<pre>
dp_atclose sockId append callback
</pre>
Append callback to the end of the dp_atclose list associated with
sockId.
<pre>
dp_atclose sockId appendUnique callback
</pre>
Appends callback to the end of  the  dp_atclose  list  associated
with sockId if it's not already a member of the list.
<pre>
dp_atclose sockId prepend callback
</pre>
Inserts callback at the front of the dp_atclose  list  associated
with sockId.
<pre>
dp_atclose sockId insert beforeCallback callback
</pre>
Inserts callback before beforeCallback in the dp_atclose list associated
with sockId.  If beforeCallback is not in the dp_atclose
list associated with sockId, no action is taken.
<pre>
dp_atclose sockId delete callback
</pre>
Delete callback from the dp_atclose list associated with  sockId.
If callback is not in the dp_atclose list associated with sockId,
no action is taken.
<pre>
dp_atclose sockId clear
</pre>
Clears the dp_atclose list associated with sockId.
