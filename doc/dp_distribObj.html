<P>
The distributed object commands described here are  part  of  the
Tcl-DP  (Tcl Distributed Programming) extension to Tcl/Tk.  These
Tcl/Tk commands are used to manage objects which are  distributed
among  several  Tcl/Tk  processes.   The Tcl/Tk processes must be
linked by Tcl-DP remote procedure call (RPC) connections.
<P>
An object in Tcl-DP is a procedure, just like a  widget  instance
of Tk is a procedure.  A procedural object must take as its first
argument a method selector.  In other words,  if  object  is  the
name of a procedural object:
<pre>
object method ?args ...?
</pre>
Objects can have slots.  Objects which are to be distributed  using
Tcl-DP must handle three methods, configure and slot-value,
which access the slots of the object, and destroy, which destroys
the object.
<P>
The configure method must handle three different forms  of  arguments,
which makes it very much like the configure option for Tk
widgets:
<pre>
object configure ?-slot?
object configure ?-slot value ...?
object configure
</pre>
When the Tcl/Tk expression "object configure" is  evaluated,  the
return  value  is  a  list of triplets of the form {-slot default
current}, one triplet for each slot  of  the  object.   The  slot
gives  the  name  of the slot, default gives the default value of
the slot when the  object  is  created,  and  current  gives  the
current  value  of the slot within the object.  Furthermore, when
the command "object configure -slot"  is  evaluated,  the  return
value  should be the triplet associated with the given slot.  The
command "object configure -slot value" will set the value of  the
slot of the object to the given value.
<P>
The slot-value method must take one argument:
<pre>
object slot-value ?slot?
</pre>
The slot-value method returns the current value of a slot  of  an
object.
<P>
The destroy method takes no arguments:
<pre>
object destroy
</pre>
The destroy method frees up all memory associated  with  the  ob-
ject, and deletes the command "object" from the interpreter.
<P>
Objects are usually defined in C for speed, with a Tcl access in-
terface,  just  like Tk widgets are defined in C but have Tcl ac-
cess interfaces.   Objects  can  also  be  defined  using  Tcl/Tk
scripting only, as Tcl-DP supplies several utility procedures for
<a href="dp_object.html">creating objects</a> with Tcl/Tk scripting only.
<P>
Each object to be distributed must also support a creator command
or  makeCmd.   This  is the command used to create an object.  It
should be of the form  "makeCmd  objName  ?-slot1  value1  -slot2
value2  ...?".   This  command  should create a procedural object
called objName and initialize the slots the of new object.
<P>
For example, suppose a point object named p1 has two slots, x and
y, and the default value for each slot is 0.  Suppose the current
value of x is 1 and the current value of y is 2.  If the  makeCmd
is called point, then to create such an object, evaluate the command
"point p1 -x 1 -y 2".  Then the  command  "p1  config"  will
have  the  return  value  of {{-x 0 1} {-y 0 2}}, the command "p1
config -x" will have the return value of -x 0 1, and the  command
"p1 slot-value x" will have the return value of 1.
<P>
Several assumptions were made in the development of  the  distributed
object system.  First, the graph of RPC connected processes
is assumed to  be  acyclic.   If  this  assumption  is  violated,
deadlock  could  result.   Second,  each slot of an object has an
owner process.  Although the value of a slot can be  set  in  any
process, it is most efficient to do so in the owner process.
<pre>
dp_setf object slot value
</pre>
The dp_setf command is used to set the value of a slot in a  distributed
object.  The side effect of this command includes replicating the new
value of the slot to all processes where  the  object is distributed.
<pre>
dp_getf object slot
</pre>
The dp_getf command is used to get the current value of a slot in
a  distributed object.  It is the counterpart of the dp_setf command.
<pre>
dp_DistributeObject object processes makeCmd
</pre>
Dp_DistributeObject arranges for object to be distributed to  the
given  processes.   The argument object should be the name of the
object to be distributed, processes should be a list of  sockId's
(which we can use with dp_RPC) which represent connections to remote
processes, and makeCmd should be the creator command for the
object, as described above.
<pre>
dp_UndistributeObject object processes
</pre>
Dp_UndistributeObject arranges for the slots of object to not  be
shared  anymore  with  remote  processes.   The  processes (which
should be a list of sockId's which represent  dp_RPC  connections
to  remote  processes) supplied should be the same as or a subset
of the processes originally passed into dp_DistributeObject.  The
object still exists in all processes, but its slots are no longer
shared.
<pre>
dp_SetTrigger when object slot trigger-list
</pre>
Dp_SetTrigger is used to cause each Tcl command  in  trigger-list
to be evaluated whenever a call to dp_setf causes the slot of object
to change value.  If  when  is  "before,"  each  command  in
trigger-list  will  be  evaluated before the slot is updated.  If
when is "after," each command in trigger-list will  be  evaluated
after  the  slot is set.  The following commands can also be used
to manipulate this trigger-list.
<pre>
dp_GetTriggers when object slot cmd
</pre>
Dp_GetTriggers returns the trigger list associated with  slot  of
object.
<pre>
dp_AppendTrigger when object slot cmd
</pre>
Dp_AppendTrigger is used to add cmd to the trigger list associated
with slot of object.
<pre>
dp_AppendTriggerUnique when object slot cmd
</pre>
Dp_AppendTriggerUnique is used to add cmd to the trigger list associated
with  slot of object only if cmd is not already part of
the trigger list.
<pre>
dp_ReleaseTrigger when object slot cmd
</pre>
Dp_ReleaseTrigger deletes cmd from the  trigger  list  associated
with slot of object.
<pre>
dp_ClearTrigger when object slot
</pre>
Dp_ClearTrigger clears the trigger list associated with  slot  of
object.
