This directory contains example Tcl/Tk applications that use Tcl-DP.  
The examples supplied (in order from simple to complex) are:

    telnet.tk	- A very simple telnet-like interface in Tcl-DP.  Run with:
		  "dpwish -notk -f telnet.tk localhost 25"
    id		- integer identifier server
    conference	- multiperson conference server
    tictactoe	- multiplayer game, uses Tk

The first two applications use terminal I/O -- you can run them
with "dpwish -notk".  The third uses graphics, so you'll need to
use dpwish.
