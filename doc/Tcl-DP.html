<h3>Tcl-DP - distributed programming extension to Tcl/Tk</h3>
</head>
<body>
Tcl-DP is a freely distributable extension to Tcl/Tk  and  stands
for  Tcl Distributed Programming.  Tcl-DP adds TCP and IP connection
management, remote procedure call (RPC), and distributed object
support to Tcl/Tk.  Tcl stands for Tool Command Language, a
freely distributable, embeddable scripting language.  Tk stands
for  Toolkit,  a freely distributable X windows widget set extension to Tcl.
<P>
This page provides an overview of the Tcl-DP programmer interface.
The Tcl/Tk commands provided by Tcl-DP can be separated into three levels:
<P>
Tcl-DP adds to Tcl/Tk several commands which manage basic TCP and
IP  network  connections.  Among these connection management commands
are dp_address, dp_accept, dp_connect, shutdown, dp_sendTo,
dp_receiveFrom, and dp_filehandler.  These commands provide basically
the same level of service as the UNIX C  socket(2)  related
system calls.
<P>
These connection management commands return and take as arguments
identifiers  called  sockId's.   (A sockId represents a UNIX file
descriptor, which UNIX uses to represent both open files and open
sockets.   A  socket  is  an  endpoint of network communication.)
These sockId's are identical to the  identifiers  manipulated  by
the read, gets, puts, and close file management commands of Tcl.
<P>
The RPC commands of Tcl-DP are implemented on top of the  connection
management  commands  listed above.  For speed, some of the
RPC commands are actually implemented  in  C  instead  of  Tcl/Tk
scripting.    These   RPC   commands   include  dp_MakeRPCServer,
dp_MakeRPCClient, dp_RPC, and dp_CloseRPC.  The basic dp_RPC command
has the following form:
<pre>
dp_RPC sockId ?args?
</pre>
Here is an example usage:
<pre>
dp_RPC file4 puts stdout "hello world"
</pre>
The above RPC command will send its  args  argument  (the  string
{puts  stdout  "hello  world"})  to the connected remote process,
represented by file4.  The remote process will evaluate the received
args string in its Tcl interpreter.  Any return value will
be sent back to the waiting RPC caller process.  Since  all  data
and  commands in Tcl/Tk are strings, there are no data conversion
or format problems.
<P>
The <a href="dp_object.html">distributed object</a> commands
of Tcl-DP are implemented on  top of the RPC commands described
above.  An object in Tcl-DP is a
procedure, just like a widget instance of Tk is a  procedure.   A
procedural object must take as its first argument a method selector.
In other words, if object is the name of a  procedural  object:
<pre>
object method ?args ...?
</pre>
Objects can have slots.  Objects which are to be distributed  using
Tcl-DP  must  handle  two methods, configure and slot-value,
which access the slots of the object.
<P>
The configure method must handle three different forms  of  arguments,
which makes it very much like the configure option for Tk widgets:
<pre>
object configure ?-slot?
object configure ?-slot value ...?
object configure
</pre>
The slot-value method must take one argument:
<pre>
object slot-value ?slot?
</pre>
Objects are usually defined in C for speed but have a Tcl  access
interface.  For example, Tk widgets are defined in C but have Tcl
access interfaces.  Objects can  also  be  defined  using  Tcl/Tk
scripting only, as Tcl-DP supplies several utility procedures for
creating and manipulating objects  with  Tcl/Tk  scripting  only.
<P>
Once you have created an object, you may distribute  that  object
among    several    RPC    connected    processes.     Use    the
dp_DistributeObject  and  dp_UndistributeObject  commands.   (The
graph of RPC connections among these processes must be acyclic.)
<P>
Once an object is distributed, use the dp_setf and  dp_getf  commands,
not  the  configure and slot-value methods, to access the
slots of the distributed object.  These two commands, dp_setf and
dp_getf,  replicate any slot value changes to all processes where
the object is distributed.
<P>
You may set triggers on any slot of any Tcl-DP distributed object
with  the  dp_SetTrigger,  and  associated commands.  Trigger are
code that is evaluated when the value of  a  slot  in  an  object
changes.
<P>
A C language interface is provided for several of the commands of
Tcl-DP. See <A HREF="DP_Address3.html">DP Address</A>,
<a href="DP_Packet3.html">DP Packet</A>,
and <a href="DP_RPC3.html">DP RPC</A>.
<P>
The Tcl-DP package provides little support for access and
authentication security.  With Tcl-DP, any process can send any Tcl/Tk
command to any remote process.
<P>
A standard measure is to remove or  undefine  "dangerous"  Tcl/Tk
commands,  through  the Tcl rename command.  Some of the Tcl commands
which you would probably want to remove include open, exec,
proc, dp_connect (from Tcl-DP), and lastly rename.
<P>
The procedure auto_load_all is supplied, which  will  source  all
autoloading  Tcl  library  scripts  not  already  source'd.   Use
auto_load_all before you undefine the Tcl proc command.
