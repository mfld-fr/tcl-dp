This README describes the purpose of the /etc/dpcap file and
gives hints on how to install it.  

The machine running the services server and all machines which access
it must have an /etc/dpcap file. These /etc/dpcap files contain
the name of the machine and the host name and port number for the
services server.

The file dpcap is a sample, template dpcap file.  Copy 
this template dpcap file to the /etc directory for each machine. 
Edit these /etc/dpcap files to reflect the setup at your
location.  You will most likely need root or owner access to
write into the /etc directory.  Don't forget to make /etc/dpcap
readable to everyone.  After you are done editing the /etc/dpcap
file, change its protections so that it is not writable, for
security reasons!

The file dpcap.tcl is an autoloading Tcl/Tk script.
The main effect of this Tcl script is to fill the global 
associative array named "dpcap" with information about the host.
As is, this array only contains the host name of the machine
and the location of the services server. However, it can easily be
extended to hold more information specific to the machine for use
by Tcl-DP scripts.  For instance, for multimedia applications,
information about the video compression/decompression hardware 
on the host can be added.

You must copy this file to the directory where the Tcl/Tk stores your
existing autoloading Tcl/Tk scripts.  Look at the value of the
TCL_LIBRARY in your environment variables or in the Tcl Makefile
for the path of this directory.  Edit the tclIndex file in that
directory to include information about the dpcap.tcl file you
just copied over or have Tcl/Tk automatically update that
tclIndex file with the "auto_mkindex" Tcl command.
