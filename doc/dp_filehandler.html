The dp_isready command  checks  whether  sockId  is  readable  or
writeable using a select(2) system call.  It returns a list of up
two boolean values (i.e., 1 or 0).   The  first  value  specifies
whether sockId is readable, and the second value specifies wheth-
er sockId is writeable.  For example, the tcl expression
<pre>
if [lindex [dp_isready file3] 1] {MyOutput file3}
</pre>
calls MyOutput if file3 is writeable.
<P>
The dp_update command is equivalent to the Tk  "update"  command,
except  that  it operates even if a connection to the X server is
not present.  See the Tk documentation on "update" for an  expla-
nation of it's usage.
<P>
The dp_after command is equivalent to the Tk "after" command, ex-
cept that it operates even if a connection to the X server is not
present.  See the Tk documentation on "after" for an  explanation
of it's usage.
<P>
The dp_whenidle command arranges for the specified Tcl/Tk command
to be evaluated whenever the system is about to go to sleep wait-
ing for an event to occur.
<P>
The dp_waitvariable command is equivalent to the Tk "tkwait vari-
able"  command,  except  that it operates even if a connection to
the X server  is  not  present.   See  the  Tk  documentation  on
"tkwait" for an explanation of it's usage.
<P>
The dp_filehander command allows one to specify a Tcl/Tk  command
which  will be evaluated whenever the file descriptor represented
by sockId is readable, writable, and/or has an exceptional condi-
tion pending.  Command will be invoked with two arguments append-
ed: a single character indicating the mode ('r',  'w',  or  'e'),
and the sockId.
<P>
A sockId is an identifier which represents a file descriptor.  It
is  identical  to  the  identifier manipulated by the Tcl-DP (Tcl
Distributed Programming) network connection  management  commands
(dp_connect,  dp_shutdown,  etc.).  SockId's are also manipulated
by the read, eof, gets, puts, and close file management  commands
of Tcl.
<P>
The mode argument indicates the situations when the command  will
be evaluated.  It may be any combination of the following values:
<P><UL><LI>
r - Eval command whenever there is data to be read from the sockId.
The  command is evaluated with two arguments appended: r to indi-
cate that data is readable on the file descriptor, and the  sock-
Id,  which  represents the file descriptor that is readable.  The
command should read at least some data from the sockId, or other-
wise command will be called continuously.
</LI><LI>
w - Eval command whenever data can be written to the sockId without
blocking.   The command is evaluated with two arguments appended:
w to indicate that the file descriptor is writable, and the sock-
Id, which represents the writable file descriptor.
</LI><LI>
e - Eval command whenever there is an exceptional condition pending
on  the  sockId.  The command is evaluated with two arguments ap-
pended: e to indicate exception, and the sockId, which represents
the file descriptor with the exceptional condition.
</LI></UL>
If the mode and command arguments are  not  specified,  then  any
previously  specified  command  for  the given sockId is deleted.
Specifying a new command using the  dp_filehandler  command  will
also delete any previously specified command for a sockId.
<P>
The following file handlers create a telnet like interface to the
sendmail  process (the smtp port) running on the local host.  The
command "say" sends the string passed to it to sendmail.  The re-
ply  is  automatically  printed  on stdout by the get_remote pro-
cedure.
<pre>
proc get_remote {mode fid} {
    # Exit if remote connection closed on us.
    if {[gets $fid input] == -1} {
        puts stdout "Connection closed by foreign host."
        exit
    }
    puts stdout $input
}

proc say {args} {
    global remote
    puts $remote $args;
}

set remote [lindex [dp_connect localhost smtp] 0]
dp_filehandler $remote r get_remote
