<pre>
dp_socketOption sockId option ?arg?
</pre>
The dp_socketOption command provides access to the  setsockopt(2)
and getsockopt(2) system calls.  If the optional arg is provided,
the option is set on the socket sockId.  Otherwise,  the  current
value of option associated with sockId is returned.  Currently, 3
socket options can be adjusted:
<pre>
dp_socketOption sockId sendBuffer ?bytes?
</pre>
Sets/gets  the size of the send buffer for sockId.  The
send buffer is the number of bytes that can be  buffered  in  the
system before a send/recv or read/write call will block.  The default
value is machine dependent.
<pre>
dp_socketOption sockId recvBuffer ?bytes?
</pre>
Sets/gets the size  of
the  receive buffer for sockId.  The receive buffer is the number
of bytes that can be buffered in  the  system  before  data  will
cease  to  flow  on  a tcp socket, or be dropped on a udp socket.
The default value is machine dependent.
<pre>
dp_socketOption sockId noblock ?yes|no?
</pre>
Sets/gets the non  blocking
i/o mode for the connection associated with sockId.  This option
will change the behavior of various transmission routines as
described in dp_connect(n).  The default value is "no."
<PRE>
dp_socketOption sockId autoClose ?yes|no?
</pre>
Sets/gets the autoClose
flag for the connection associated with sockId.  If the autoClose
flag is "yes", then any errors detected in transmission will  automatically
close the file.  This case typically arrives when the
connection is closed unexpectedly.  Users can attach callbacks to
the  closing  of the file using the dp_atclose facility.  The default
value is "yes."
<PRE>
dp_socketOption sockId keepAlive  ?yes|no?
</PRE>
Sets/gets  the  "Keep
Alive"  flag  for  the tcp connection associated with sockId.  If
the "Keep Alive" flag is on, the system sends periodic  transmission
of  messages on a tcp socket.  Should  the connected  party
fail to respond to these messages, the connection  is  considered
broken  and  will  be closed automatically.  The default value is
"no."
<pre>
dp_socketOption sockId reuseAddr ?yes|no?
</pre>
Sets/gets the flag  for
local  address  reuse.  When set, other processes can "take over"
the port number of the socket.  This option is useful in combination
with server sockets (i.e., socket created using "dp_connect
-server"), since it allows the address to be  reused  immediately
if the server crashes.  The default value is "no."
<pre>
dp_socketOption sockId linger  ?seconds?
</pre>
Sets/gets  the  "linger
time"  for a socket.  A value of 0 means that, when the socket is
closed, the close function call will return immediately  and  the
system  will  attempt  to send any unsent data in the background.
If a non-zero value is specified, the close  will  block  for  at
most that many seconds have passed while the system tries to send
any unsent data.  In current implementations, the actual value of
the linger time is ignored.  The default value is 0.
<pre>
dp_socketOption sockId ttl int
</pre>
Sets/gets the ttl "Time  to  Live"
of  multicast  packets transmitted from sockId.  By using a small
value, you can limit the broadcast range of the packet.
<pre>
dp_socketOption sockId loopBack  ?yes|no?
</pre>
Sets/gets  the  "loopBack"  flag  for the multicast socket associated
with sockId.  If
the "loopBack" flag is "no", the sender will not receive  a  copy
of  the  packets  it transmits.  If the "loopBack" flag is "yes",
the sender will receive a copy of the packets it transmits.
<pre>
dp_socketOption sockId addMbr|dropMbr group
</pre>
Sets/gets the member-
ship  for the multicast socket associated with sockId.  Processes
use this option to join or leave a given  multicast  group.   The
last  argument,  group,  should  be  a valid IP-multicast address
represented in "dot" notation.
